MobileSalesTAXRatesLookup
=========================

Cross platform mobile app for sales tax rates lookup.

The app has been developed using appery platform and I have uploaded Appery Backup as well as  Android Eclipse project.
The main components are 

1. STSServiceCalls.js : Helps make REST service calls from client to Wolterskluwer SalesTaxSaaS(STS)webservices hosted at demo.myspeedtax.com
2. STSMainPageHelper.js : Interacts with the UI and calls into STSServiceCalls.js for  calls to STS.


NOTES:

1:

2: 
The app has been tested on few Android devices, IE 10.0  and few versions of Firefox and Chrome. 
For direct web access, you will need to  use a browser which supports CORS ( IE 8,9 are too limited and do not work)
